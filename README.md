# Backend
This file is the code for the back-end which is written by Java, for dealing with
operation for the system by the requirements of the clients.

# Description of the project (BackEnd)
The project aims to build a CRM system that could deal with the relationship with
Contact or schedule, there are three main functions showing below.

## Contact functions:
1. New, delete contacts on the page
2. Edit the information of a contact on the page
3. Search the contact by name or team name
4. Add mark status to the contacts

Moreover, in order to improve the efficiency and the users' experience
we decided to add a sorting function and using binary search, therefore
the following is the bonus functions and is not required by the clients.

5. Sorting the contact by name, phone, email or team name 

## Schedule functions:
1. New, delete schedule on the page
2. Edit the information of a schedule on the page
3. Show future schedules
4. Notify the related contacts

Moreover, in order to improve the efficiency and the users' experience
we decided to add a sorting function and using binary search, therefore
the following is the bonus functions and is not required by the clients.

5. Sorting a schedule by name or time
6. Search the contact by name

## Email sending functions:
The CRM could let a user send emails to contacts, or providing one or 
more valid emails

## Import/export functions:
The system support creating the information of contacts or schedules by reading a csv file. Or export the information to a csv file

# Version control Policy
1. Our team employs a version-control policy to ensure the accuracy and integrity of all
documentation.  
2. All out of date documentation is removed from the current folder and archived.  
3. The version control helps the team to understand each other's work well.  

# Merging policy
## Plan
JingJie Ding wrote contact and the overall code structure, Vuex framework and Store part.  
Ling Huang wrote dashboard and Axios part of contact and Dashboard.   
Quanying Lv writes the @Mapping which front-end interaction parts of the back end of SpringBoot.   
Yanming Guo writes about the implementation of specific functions on the back end

## The parts that need to merge
1. Merge Dashboard into a framework.  
2. All Axios parts merge into the store.  
3. merge the back-end functionality with the framework parts.  
4. Merge the front and back end.  

## Problems
1. The Scss failure to NPM install on JingJieDing 's laptop causes the dashboard's CSS to be lost. (resolved)  
 2. Cannot update the data in real-time after changing the database and need to refresh the page. (resolve)  
3. Logo cannot be shrunk as a sidebar.  
4. Dashboard's edit page has an all-black background.  
5. Axios cannot get data correctly, and POST cannot work properly. (resolved)  
6. The rear end cannot connect to the front end. (resolved)  

## Problem-solving process
A needs to merge the code with B, B needs to take A to look over THE whole code of B.
Then they discuss together where to add the code of A. If problems occur after the merge, 
discuss where problems are likely to arise and solve them together.
